# Retail Store Network Design (Packet Tracer Final Project)

This project presents a complete network design for a simulated retail store using Cisco Packet Tracer. The network spans multiple departments and includes essential services such as routing, segmentation (VLANs), and RIP configuration.

## 🧠 Project Overview

The goal of this project was to design and implement a reliable, scalable, and secure network for a retail business using:
- **Three routers**
- **Multiple switches**
- **End devices across departments**
- **RIP routing**
- **Static IP addressing**
- **Basic segmentation using VLANs**

## 🧱 Technologies Used

- Cisco Packet Tracer
- RIP (Routing Information Protocol)
- VLAN configuration
- Static IP assignment
- Serial and Fast Ethernet interfaces

## 📝 Summary

This project simulates how a medium-sized retail store might deploy a real-world LAN setup. The design was chosen for clarity, scalability, and cost efficiency, and demonstrates the ability to document, plan, and build a functioning network topology.
